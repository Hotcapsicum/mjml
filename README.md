# MJML 4

If you're looking for MJML 3.3.X check [this branch](https://github.com/mjmlio/mjml/tree/3.3.x)


# Introduction

`MJML` is a markup language created by [Mailjet](https://www.mailjet.com/) and designed to reduce the pain of coding a responsive email. Its semantic syntax makes the language easy and straightforward while its rich standard components library shortens your development time and lightens your email codebase. MJML’s open-source engine takes care of translating the `MJML` you wrote into responsive HTML.
